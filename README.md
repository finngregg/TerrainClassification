# TerrainClassification
 
This project aims to determine how the flow of water across a landscape is affected by the terrain in order to identify basins and protect crops and farmlands against potential flooding. 

In doing so, the project demonstrates the potential of parallel programming and its ability to improve not only the speed but overall processing performance when compared to sequential programming. Parallelism is defined as a technique used to make programs compute faster by performing several computations at the same time.
